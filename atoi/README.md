#This repo has a simple atoi C function implementation

The atoi() function in C takes a string (which represents an integer) as an argument
and returns its value of type int. So basically the function is used to convert a string 
argument to an integer.
 
#How to :

Compile the code with : gcc atoi.c -o atoi
Execute it by: ./atoi "156"

You will see the output : " Your number is 156"
